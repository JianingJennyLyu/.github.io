            The most visible impacts of plastic debris in ocean are the ingestion, suffocation and entanglement of hundreds of marine species and sea birds. Marine life such as sea turtles, whales, and fishes often mistakenly eat plastic because it is mistakened as preys; such as plastic bags are often mistakened as jelly fishes. Ingestion of plastic not only can cause animals to sufficate from the blockage of plastic, plastic can also take up space in the animal's stomach. The stomach cannot digest the plastic inside the stomach, and marine life and sea birds are left to starve and eventually die with a stomach full of plastic. It is also very common for marine life to get entangled in fishing gears, wrappers, and other wastes. These objects wrapped around the animal, weighing it down or hampering its movement – often leading to the animal’s death, or serious welfare issues. This can also cause the animals to drown and loose there abilities to survive in the sea.
      Some long lasting affects plastic bring to the ocean is pollution. Pollution and ingesting small amounts of plastic can stunt the growth of some marine life and slow down their reproductive rate. Overall, plastic is distrubing the natural enviornment under the sea, and distrubes the food chain and ecosystem.

             Plastic pollution gets in our major water sources which is causing humans to drink microplastic. The meat humans eat (especially sea food) also contain microplastic. Plastic contain chemicals, and a number of these chemicals have been associated with serious health problems such as cancers, infertilit, ADHD, and autism. As seen plastic pollution greatly increases the chance of recently ingesting microplastic which can cause to a series of health related problems.

             Plastic pollution has a strong connectionf with climate change. Almost all plastic are made from primarily fossil fuels. The transporting and manufacturing of huge pollutes the air. Global warming, also known as climate change, is caused by a blanket of pollution that traps heat around the earth. The massive formate of transferring and production of plastic is one of airpollution and global warming.
